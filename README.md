# List of Improvements I Might Add:

# Getting Started:
## v1.2.4 and above
1. Head to [releases](https://github.com/Acher0ns/Umbra-Menu-Injector/releases/latest/) and download `Umbra-Injector-vX.X.X.zip`
2. Extract the zip.
3. Run `UmbraInjector.exe`
4. Press the `Inject` button while the game is open.

Note: Make sure `UmbraInjector.exe` and the `Data` folder stay in the same directory.

## v1.2.3 and below
### Requirements
- [ ] A Mono Injector. [Sharpmonoinjector](https://github.com/warbler/SharpMonoInjector) is recommended and is used in this tutorial.

Note: Must use the CLI version of sharp mono injector. The GUI version doesn't work properly.


1. Head to [releases](https://github.com/Acher0ns/Umbra-Mod-Menu/releases) and download `UmbraMenu-vX.X.zip`
2. Extract the zip
3. Use your favorite mono injector to inject the dll (If you do not know how to use sharpmonoinjector, scroll down to that section)
```
Namespace: UmbraRoR
Class: Loader
Method: Load
```

## How to use sharpmonoinjector
After you have your dll file, you'll need to have a way to inject it into the game. There are 2 option Command line or with a batch file.
### Command line
1. Once you have sharpmonoinjector downloaded from [here](https://github.com/warbler/SharpMonoInjector/releases/download/v2.2/SharpMonoInjector.Console.zip), extract the zip.

2. Next open a command prompt window as administrator and type the command:

`cd "[path to folder with smi.exe in it]"` 

obviously replacing [path to folder with smi.exe in it] with the proper path (keep the quotes). For example my command is:

`cd "C:\Users\Username\Documents\My Cheats\RoR2\SharpMonoInjector.Console\SharpMonoInjector.Console"`

3. You can tell if you're in the proper directory if you type `dir` and you see SharpMonoInjector.dll and smi.exe listed

4. Once you are in the proper directory and Risk of Rain 2 is open, type 

`smi.exe inject -p "Risk of Rain 2" -a "[Path to UmbraRoR.dll]" -n UmbraRoR -c Loader -m Load` 

again replacing [Path to UmbraRoR.dll] with the proper path (keep the quotes)

### Batch file
1. Once you have sharpmonoinjector downloaded from [here](https://github.com/warbler/SharpMonoInjector/releases/download/v2.2/SharpMonoInjector.Console.zip), extract the zip.
2. Right click on your Desktop -> New -> Text Document
3. Open the text document and paste the following
```
@echo off
cd "[path to folder with smi.exe]"
cls
smi.exe inject -p "Risk of Rain 2" -a "[Path to UmbraRoR.dll]" -n UmbraRoR -c Loader -m Load
pause
```
4. Replace [path to folder with smi.exe] and [Path to UmbraRoR.dll] with the proper paths (keep quotes if they are there)
5. Press ctrl+shift+s and name it `start.bat` (make sure you replace .txt with .bat)
6. If everything was done properly, while the game is open just run `start.bat` as administrator and the Menu should automatically be injected into the game
